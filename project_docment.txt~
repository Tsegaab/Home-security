Most IP cameras provide a basic video stream in Motion-JPEG format — basically a constantly updating stream of JPEG-compressed bitmap files. MotionJpegImageView provides a simple interface for creating and displaying these streams within an Android and iOS application.

most people will want to secure their video feeds with a username and password, and often encrypt the stream using HTTPS. 

we use peer-to-peer videostreaming 
Peer-to-peer video streaming systems offer the same advantages as peer-
to-peer file transfer networks but face additional challenges since data transfer
needs to occur continuously to avoid playout interruptions. This is particularly
difficult since the peers are connected to the Internet by links which may have
different capacity and reliability. Moreover, data delivery paths may simply
disappear without prior notice, e.g., when a peer leaves the broadcast. This
challenging environment is a perfect field of application for recent advances
in compression, streaming, and networking and a catalyst for new progress.
Remarkably, functioning solutions have emerged and the research community
now expects that in the future peer-to-peer video streaming system will be
used for large-scale live television distribution over the Internet.

OpenCv is Intel’s Open Source Computer Vision library.

The name OpenCV has become synonymous with computer vision, but what is OpenCV? OpenCV is a collection of software algorithms put together in a library to be used by industry and academia for computer vision applications and research. OpenCV started at Intel in the mid 1990s as a method to demonstrate how to accelerate certain algorithms in hardware. In 2000, Intel released OpenCV to the open source community as a beta version, followed by v1.0 in 2006. In 2008, Willow Garage took over support for OpenCV and immediately released v1.1.


I use Berkeley Sockets (Berkeley sockets (or BSD sockets) is a computing library with an application programming interface (API) for internet sockets and Unix domain sockets, used for inter-process communication (IPC).
As the API has evolved with little modification from a de facto standard into part of the POSIX specification, POSIX sockets are basically Berkeley sockets.) that is widely available on Unix-like systems for the networking code.

The Operating System is Unix-like. Therefore we're using POSIX Threads (POSIX Threads, usually referred to as Pthreads, is a POSIX standard for threads. The standard, POSIX.1c, Threads extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), defines an API for creating and manipulating threads.
Implementations of the API are available on many Unix-like POSIX-conformant operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris. DR-DOS and Microsoft Windows implementations also exist: within the SFU/SUA subsystem which provides a native implementation of a number of POSIX APIs, and also within third-party packages such as pthreads-w32,[1] which implements pthreads on top of existing Windows API.) and Berkeley Sockets.


Only one client connected at a time.
The client knows the width and the height of the expected frame.
The client receives grayscaled (single channel) frames.


The server part consists of two parts.1, One who read the video input in a loop, and the 2, other waits for the client to connect and send the video frames.

In the diagram above, we see two threads running on the server side: Frame Grabber and Stream Server. The input is taken from a webcam, but you can use other resources too, like an avi file.

Frame Grabber grabs a frame from the webcam and stores it to a global variable img. Stream Server waits for a client to connect. Once the connection has established, it sends img to the client repeatedly whenever a newer version of img is available.
